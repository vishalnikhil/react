parecel is very powerful
package-json

i can use vite in the place of parcel

root.render

react alone is not powerful but the things react use makes it powerful like the parcel

hashing concept

props

and till now i know hooks , useState  

diff algo is also something that makes react faster

old virtual dom gets compared with current virtual dom and then updates

this algo comes under React fiber --- this finds the new diff and updates the dom


vitual dom is an object

react doesnt touch the real dom so much

react is fast because it does efficient dom manipulation ( virtual dom ) how-react fibre learn it

useState return an array you can destructure it on fly

react through virtual dom keeps ui layer and data layer in sync 


..microservice architecture // monolitic

why microserives  // single responsibility 

   all the services talk to each other in microservice 

    you can write each service in different lang and it gets integrated

different serives can be held at different ports


shimmer ui-- we show fake cards before actuall api is called and data is retrived
it shows the skeleton that will be getting actual data after api is called   (conditonal rendering)

  useeffect==cors error

swiggy ,zomato, yt alll uses it

===

since the login btn is a const how does it gets updated as logout ..this breaks the rule right no when you call the onclick func then the whole component in which the btn is present gets re rendered and now the btn variable has a different value this is beauty of reach ,amazing isn't it

only then button compenend gets re render not the whole page,thats cool and now this is the beauty of useState

and dont forget Parcel is a beast :) <3000 (tree shaking)
